Bootcamp Homework 5: Work Day Scheduler (Third-Party APIs)

## My Workday Scheduler

In this project, we were asked to modify a starter code to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). 

## Resources

I used the following references for this assignment:

**Day.js** (https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) to display the current date and time.
